Server Authentication
	- the client needs to trust the AGWA CA cert
	- then you will receive request to provide client certificate
	- if you present self-signed certificate to acceptance

	- if you get a certificate given by entrust
		- it is already in PSE
		- secure storage of the Certificate Authorities that we trust
		- if you're coming with a certificate delivered by Entrust CA
		- verify if we loaded
		- denial possibility if it is not aligned - which is extremely probable
		- it controls who gets in is who they say they are 
		
	- don't use the same cert between Acceptance/Production
	- P&G is working with extremely important 

	- if you establish https connectivity 
	- the gateway will route the SOAP URL to PI
	- the IP we received are the IP addresses of the Gateway, you need to access to this IP from AWS
		- ports and ip
	- the PI system will request username/password (then you're in SAP)

	- we do not have certificate authentication at the layer at SOAP


	- WE NEED STANDARD RFC from SAP
	- check layer that is added on top
	- Z RFC READ TABLE (maybe)
	- don't think about using the direct one, only if user is present in 
	- need to confirm what that it has a z in front on the RFC side
